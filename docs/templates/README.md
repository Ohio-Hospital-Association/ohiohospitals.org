As part of the 2018 website update, a range of page templates were designed to accomodate to the various needs

## Methodology

If you're familiar with the OHA website, prior to 2018, the functionality of each of the page templates is very similar to that of the home page. The way the page templates display each of their sections (eg. feature, content blocks, etc.) is identical to the way the home page displays images in the slider or the topics in the middle column. Just as those sections have a specific folder under the home page (eg. "Slider", "Topics") containing specific page types:
<img :src="$withBase('/screenshots/primary-landing.png')" alt="Primary landing page screenshot">

each of the page templates has their own sets of folders (eg. "Cards", "Content-Blocks") containing specific page types (eg. "OHA Card", "OHA Content Block"). See the example below for a page using the Primary Landing Page template:
<img :src="$withBase('/screenshots/primary-landing.png')" alt="Primary landing page screenshot">
