# Adding and Optimizing Images

Images make up a large part of the new OHA website. It's important to follow the steps below to ensure that those images appear clearly on all devices and screen sizes, while being small enough in file size that it doesn't affect the page load time.

## Formatting and Exporting Images

If possible, all images should be exported from Photoshop, or whatever photo editing application is being used, at 72dpi. This is important for ensuring that the image is not blurry on things like the iPhone's retina screen. If possible, export the file as a JPG. This will allow for smaller file sizes while still retaining the image quality.

## Editing and Optimizing Images for the Web

Image file size is one of, if not the primary cause of slow page load times. This is especially true on OHA's website. Keeping page loads quick leads to more user engagement, less data use on mobile devices, and higher SEO rankings. If possible, try to keep images under 75kb, especially if there are a lot of images on the page. It's also **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to run the image through an image optimization service before uploading it to the media library. [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) does a great job of optimizing and reducing the file size for both JPG's and PNG's without reducing the quality of the image and all you have to do it drag and drop your file into the site.
