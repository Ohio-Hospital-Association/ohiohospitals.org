# Converting a Page to a New Template
If a page exists in the current page hierarchy, but is either not using a new template, or using the incorrect template for the page's level within the hierarchy, follow the steps below to convert it.

## Navigate to Templates Tab
Once you've navigated to the page you'd like to edit in the content tree, select the "Properties" tab and choose the "Template" option.

## Select a Page Template
The next step is to choose the template that you'd like to use for the page. Each template has a well-defined use case, so take a look at the [Template Doumentation](/templates/) for more information on the available templates. All of them can be found in the "OHA" folder on the left side of the popup. Click on the template you'd like, and make sure the "Use existing template" option is selected at the top of the popup. Click save and move on to the next step. **Make sure the "Use page template settings" option is selected in the "Page nesting" section at the bottom of the page.**

## Configure Page Settings

If you're converting a page to a new template, chances are that page existed before the 2018 website rework. This means that it likely doesn't have all of the correct settings configured to comply with the new design. Make sure the following items have been configured before moving on to the next step.
- [Update the page's URL](/guides/adding-page.html#updating-the-url) to comply with OHA's new standards
- [Configure the metadata](/guides/page-metadata.md) for the new page. **This step is very important.**
- If your page should appear in the main mega menu, [follow these steps](/guides/adding-page.html#add-the-page-to-the-mega-menu).

## Final Configuration

At this point all of the general settings for the page have been configured and you have selected the new template. From here, you'll follow the specific steps for the page template you have chosen. For example, you might have to add a "Feature" folder and add an "OHA Feature" to it, or edit the heading above the cards section. Head over to the [Template Doumentation](/templates/) to configure the page for your chosen template.
