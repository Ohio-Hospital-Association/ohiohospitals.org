# Adding a New Page <Badge text="Under Construction" type="warn"/>

If the specific page you need doesn't exist, follow the steps below to add a new page. Much of the page configuration is unique to the template you choose, so be sure to follow the steps for your specific template closely.

## Selecting the Location in the Content Tree
Each page should carefully live in a specific layer within the content tree. For example, all primary landing pages are meant to be in the first level, followed by secondary landing pages under those, etc. Once you have found the existing page that your new one should "live under" (eg. the "State and Federal Issues" page lives under the "Advocacy" page), right click on it and select `New > Page (menu item)`

## Choosing a Page Name

## Selecting a Template

## Updating the URL

## Configure the Page Metadata

## Add the Page to the Mega Menu

## Final Configuration
At this point all of the general settings for the page have been configured. From here, you'll follow the specific steps for the page template you have chosen. For example, you might have to add a "Feature" folder and add an "OHA Feature" to it, or edit the heading above the cards section.
