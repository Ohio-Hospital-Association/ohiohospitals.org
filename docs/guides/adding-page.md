# Adding a New Page <Badge text="Under Construction" type="warn"/>

If the specific page you need doesn't exist, follow the steps below to add a new page. Much of the page configuration is unique to the template you choose, so be sure to follow the steps for your specific template closely.

## Selecting the Location in the Content Tree

Each page should carefully live in a specific layer within the content tree. For example, all primary landing pages are meant to be in the first level, followed by secondary landing pages under those, etc. Once you have found the existing page that your new one should "live under" (eg. the "State and Federal Issues" page lives under the "Advocacy" page), right click on it and select `New > Page (menu item)`

Unless you're adding a new primary landing page, you should always be right clicking and adding a new page from an existing page. It's important that it's not a folder (eg. a "Feature" folder that should only contain OHA Feature items), so that it maintains the page hierarchy.

## Selecting a Template

The next step is to choose the template that you'd like to use for the page. Each template has a well-defined use case, so take a look at the [Template Doumentation](/templates/) for more information on the available templates. All of them can be found in the "OHA" folder on the left side of the popup. Click on the template you'd like, and make sure the "Use existing template" option is selected at the top of the popup. Click save and move on to the next step.

## Final Configuration

At this point all of the general settings for the page have been configured. From here, you'll follow the specific steps for the page template you have chosen. For example, you might have to add a "Feature" folder and add an "OHA Feature" to it, or edit the heading above the cards section. Head over to the [Template Doumentation](/templates/) to configure the page for your chosen template.
