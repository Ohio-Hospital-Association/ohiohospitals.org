# Configuring Page Metadata

Properly configuring each page's metadata is necessary for a variety of reasons, but most importantly for improving accessibility and SEO. For more information on website metadata, take a look at [this article](https://blog.tbhcreative.com/2018/07/metadata-pro-tips-for-2018.html). By default, all of the metadata settings inheret whatever settings their parent page has set. This hurts SEO rankings and accessibility because it means that multiple pages are sharing the same data. 

Once you've navigated to the page you'd like to configure, click on the "Properties" tab and select "Metadata". Follow the steps below for additional information on each of the available fields. For each of the fields, you will need to uncheck the "Inherit" checkbox and modify the text below it.

## Title

The title is the most important field to set. This field weighs heavily on 508-compliance and SEO performance. You should always have a unique title tag on every page that describes the page. Once you have set the title, it will appear in the format: "Title | Ohio Hospital Association". For example, if you set the title field to "About OHA", the final title will be "About OHA | Ohio Hospital Association".

## Description

Most users will not see the page description, but it is again especially important for accessibility. It allows users on screen readers to get a quick synopsis of a page without having to navigate through the page itself. This meta tag doesn't influence SEO page ranking, but it's very important regardless. It's the ad copy that will determine if users click on your result. Try to keep it within 160 characters, and write it to catch the user's attention. From an SEO-perspective, you want to sell the page and get them to click on the result. Here's a great article on [meta descriptions](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description) that goes into more detail.

## Keywords

Keywords don't hold nearly as much value as they once did on the web. While no good SEO advice is going to recommend spending any time on this tag, there's some very small possibility it could help you somewhere. Feel free to inherit the default settings for this field, but if you'd like to try to give a slight boost to the SEO results for the page, set the keywords to a comma delimited list of keywords that are related to the content on the page.

## Tags <Badge text="Under Construction" type="warn"/>

Tags do not appear to the user, which means they don't affect accessiblity or SEO, but they are used internally at OHA to group content. For this reason, this field is just as important as the title and description.
